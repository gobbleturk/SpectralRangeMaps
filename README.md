To get started, try running the example fullFlowG script. It requires the statscollection toolbox for the clustering evaluation.

The main customizations desired are likely in the final plotting. However different use cases will have different desires for the plot 
so the specific custom plots we created for the paper are not included in this repo, so users will have to write their own custom plotting
scripts. If you would like to see the scripts we used for the paper, don't hesitate to reach out mbd83@cornell.edu
